                <p class="header-subtitle">Hello! My name is Michael Czolko and I'm a Software Engineer from Prague, Czech Republic. I've always been hungry for knowledge so I decided to expand my skills and move to the UK.
I've started making websites when I was young and programming quickly became my passion. I was expanding my love for writing code at high school. My main focus is to write a cleaner code with a proper architecture using productive tools. I prefer quality over quantity!
One of my dreams is to become a student again and study machine learning or deep learning. On the one hand, it's just a dream and on the other hand chasing dreams is a great fun!</p>

The software compares various attributes of products which helps users with their buying decisions. The project has become successful and it was crucial to focus on scalability and performance of the entire project. It was a first time in my life when I wrote tests for my code.

                        After I finished the Wikidi project, I have become a full-time JavaScript developer on <a href="http://flowreader.com/">flowreader.com</a>. We have built the project from scratch and I was in charge of the decision about technology we would use on a frontend because it was a single page application. The decision was Google Closure. The benefits were static analysis of the code (type checking) and compiler which squeeze the application into 40kb. When the application got bigger we added ReactJS in order to improve scalability. Rendering components became much easier to develop or debug. Great times!

                        <p class="description">Yes, that's right! I do love programming and I have to say it affects my personal life in many ways. My passion drives me to write a neat code, moreover, I'm studying design patterns and best practices to keep myself on the edge in a huge range of technologies and principles</p>

                        <p class="description">As previously mentioned – I enjoy studying and reading about a software development in order to make my picture about programming wider. I am trying to understand as much as possible how a designer or a server admin see the application. I believe finding a path between those two worlds is the best way how to achieve an exceptional user experience.</p>

                        <p class="description">Michael is great developer with sence for humor. He knows a lot about JavaScript and modern front-end technologies. It was nice to work with him. I definitely recommend him!

                        <p>Web Developer at Wikidi a.s.</p>
                        <p class="description">Working with Michael is a pure fun, his geeky, nerdy jokes have made me cry for quite a lot of times. From the professional perspective, he is really keen and curious about technology. He has this - I would say feature - which is the fact that his code is usually cleaner than your toilet. It was my pleasure to work with him as you dont meet meet this type of guy very often. He also has a solid background about PHP &amp; Symfony2, general design Patterns (when to use them as well), and even some mobile development I definitely recommend Michael as a Software Developer.

                        <p class="description">Michael has real programming talent. He loves beautiful and maintainable code. He is quite passionate about re-usable code and the separaton of logic from design. His passion is in a level that when he doesn't like the way people code around him (i.e. the 'wrong' way), he simply cannot stay there for long! I'd recommend him to the fullest.
